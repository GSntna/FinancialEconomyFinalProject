## Abstract

This paper takes a time series approach to study the relationship between Unemployment Rate and Crime Rate in the United States throught the years 1960 to 2019. To do this, a Vector Autorregressive (VAR) model was used to see the effect of unemployment on crime. This project has as it's main objective to determine if the theoretical relationship between both variables can be verified empirically. 

The historic crime data was extracted from the FBI public records, categorized by crime; while the unemployment data was obtained through the US Bureau of Labour Statistics.
